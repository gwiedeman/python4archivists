      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Alvin Bernard Ford (1953-1991) was convicted of first-degree murder in the 
	  slaying of a police officer in a failed robbery attempt in Florida on July 21, 
	  1974. Ford entered prison at the age of 20 and was sentenced to die by electrocution 
	  in two separate criminal proceedings. He remained on death row until his death 
	  of natural causes on February 28, 1991 at the age of 37. </p>
      <p>Ford was fighting depression and a drug addiction when he became involved in 
	  a robbery attempt at a Red Lobster restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale Florida in 1974. 
	  Ford's three accomplices left him at the scene with police approaching. In a 
	  panicked state, Ford chose to escape by taking the car of a police officer who 
	  was not aware of the severity of the situation when he arrived alone. Ford shot 
	  the officer twice in the abdomen and once in the back of the head while retrieving 
	  the officer's car keys. After being apprehended at his mother's home in Gainesville, 
	  Florida, Ford spent his first six years in prison under normal health conditions. 
	  In late 1981, at the end of the appeals process and within hours of his execution, 
	  Ford's mental condition deteriorated dramatically. For the next nine years he 
	  moved in and out of schizophrenia, which finally developed into sustained psychosis 
	  by the time his second death warrant was signed in 1984.</p>
      <p>The Alvin Ford case was lengthy in part because of the questions that had not 
	  been answered adequately until his case was brought before the U.S. Supreme 
	  Court. The U.S. Supreme Court's verdict in the Ford case brought stricter guidelines 
	  than previously existed for determining if someone is mentally fit to defend 
	  himself in trial and whether the mentally ill should receive the death penalty. 
	  Capital punishment experts Kent S. Miller and Michael L. Radelet have written 
	  of the impact the Ford v. Wainwright decision had on the treatment of mentally 
	  ill prisoners on death row saying, "Alvin Ford made history as the man who forced 
	  the criminal justice authorities, lawyers, judges, politicians, mental heath 
	  professionals, and a host of others to seriously debate the question of what 
	  types of mental illness should exempt condemned prisoners from execution and 
	  how (and by whom) these life-and-death determinations should be made," according to Kent Millar and Michael Radelet,
	  in their book, <emph render="italic">Executing the Mentally Ill: The Criminal Justice System and the Case of Alvin Ford</emph></p>
      <p>The legal process of taking Ford's capital punishment case from arrest to execution 
	  in Florida involved many opportunities for him to appeal to circuit courts of 
	  appeal, the U.S. and Florida Supreme Courts, and the governor. After Ford's 
	  arrest on July 21, 1974, he was tried in December 1974, sentenced in early 1975, 
	  and after appeals to the Supreme Courts of Florida and the United States, received 
	  his first death warrant signed by Governor Bob Graham on November 4, 1981. The 
	  scheduled execution date was December 8, 1981. Fourteen hours before the scheduled 
	  execution Ford was granted a stay of execution by the Eleventh Circuit Court 
	  of Appeals in Atlanta. After further psychiatric evaluations, the governor's 
	  committee decided he was competent for execution and signed his second death 
	  warrant on April 30, 1984 with a scheduled execution date of May 31, 1984. Once 
	  again, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stepped in fourteen hours before 
	  Ford's scheduled execution and granted another stay of execution. When Ford's 
	  case was brought before the United States Supreme Court, it ruled on June 26, 
	  1986 that the Eighth Amendment prohibits states from inflicting the death penalty 
	  upon prisoners who are insane and found that Florida's procedures for determining 
	  sanity had failed to adequately protect Ford's rights. Ford's sanity was not 
	  decided, however, and this led to a trial in early 1989 that found Ford competent 
	  for execution. The decision by a subsequent appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court 
	  of Appeals was never passed down because Ford was found dead in his cell due 
	  to adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with fulminant acute pancreatitis 
	  on February 2, 1991.</p>
      <p>The Ford case occurred at a time in the history of capital punishment in the 
	  United States of a resurgence in a get-tough-on-crime attitude embraced by politicians 
	  who pointed, in part, to their stand on the death penalty as evidence that they 
	  were tough on crime. This period began during the Nixon administration with 
	  some critical changes in the legal system that made capital punishment legal 
	  once again in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the Ford 
	  case set an important precedent since, up until the case, there were no clear-cut 
	  protections shielding the mentally ill from execution. The ruling took the final 
	  decision out of an individual governor's hands through clemency hearings and 
	  placed it within the court system.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Information</head>
      <p>This collection documents the seventeen year period (1974-1991) concerning 
	  the Florida capital punishment case of Alvin Ford. The collection primarily 
	  contains the court records and research material of Ford's attorney, Laurin 
	  A. Wollan, Jr., as well as other members of the Ford defense team who began 
	  work on the case in 1981. The legal records include official court proceedings 
	  from the initial trial in 1974, appeals, attempts at clemency, and several 
	  cases by Ford against the Florida Department of Corrections. Other legal 
	  records include psychological reports, background reports, biographies of 
	  Ford, as well as his prison and medical records.</p>
      <p>Several participants are represented in the collection over the case's duration. 
	Robert Adams represented Ford from his initial trial until his appeal to the Florida 
	Supreme Court was denied on July 18, 1979. A community organizer from the Florida 
	Clearing House on Criminal Justice, Scharlette Holdman, located a volunteer lawyer, 
	Deborah Fins, to represent Ford in his petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme 
	Court and continued to consult for the Ford case over the next 10 years. After his 
	certiorari case was denied, Holdman and Deborah Fins recruited a more experienced 
	lawyer, Laurin A. Wollan, to represent Ford in his 1981 clemency hearings. Wollan 
	took the case pro bono and continued to work on Ford's behalf over the next 10 years. 
	Wollan was a 1962 graduate of the University of Chicago Law School. He served as a state's 
	attorney in Illinois, spent four years with the U.S. Department for Justice, and was a 
	member of the Florida State University faculty beginning in 1976. Although he was a death 
	penalty supporter and a former prosecutor, his compassion for Ford's circumstance led him 
	to accept the case on a pro bono basis. The size and scope of the files he created reveal 
	Wollan's efforts on Ford's behalf, for example, as Ford's clemency hearing quickly 
	approached in mid-1981, he was without legal representation. Wollan was asked to take 
	the case and over the next six weeks, from August through October, he worked solely on 
	the Ford case as he struggled to acquaint himself with the details of the case.  
	Attorney Richard Burr joined Wollan in volunteering to represent Ford just as Ford's 
	first execution approached in 1981.  Both remained on the Ford case until his death. 
	A number of state officials are found throughout the case's legal documents including: 
	Florida Governor Bob Graham who had the power to grant clemency to Ford; circaE. "Sonny" 
	Strickland who was superintendent of the Florida State Prison; and Louie Wainwright and 
	Richard Dugger who were Secretaries of the Department of Corrections for the State of Florida.</p>
      <p>Ford's attorneys collected many articles, pamphlets, and publications on the 
	  subject of the death penalty. The research material in this collection represents 
	  many organizations, most of which oppose the death penalty. These include the 
	  NAACP Legal Defense Fund, National Coalition Against the Death Penalty, ACLU, 
	  Florida Clearing House on Criminal Justice, Amnesty International, Institute 
	  for Southern Studies, Florida Citizens Against the Death Penalty, and the Florida 
	  Conference Against Death Penalty. The collection also reveals the sentiment 
	  of these anti-death penalty groups during a time of resurgent support for the 
	  death penalty. The news clippings are a comprehensive part of the research material 
	  covering many death penalty cases in Florida spanning two decades.</p>
      <p>The collection contains court records from at least six specific trials and 
	  many other appeals and motions that, besides chronicling the case, demonstrate 
	  one of the arguments which many anti-death penalty advocates utilize, that a 
	  death penalty case costs more than a sentence of life imprisonment. The collection 
	  is strongly enhanced by a separate collection of news clippings that directly 
	  relate to the Ford case. These news clippings are very helpful in understanding 
	  how the case developed.</p>
      <p>While the collection contains a variety of records covering not only the 
	legal aspects of the case, but also Ford himself, and presents a thorough 
	example of the nature of representing a death penalty defendant, it is understandably 
	limited to death penalty issues as they relate to the state of Florida. The 
	implications, however, of the Supreme Court ruling on the Ford case in 1986, 
	that a mentally ill prisoner cannot be executed and the resultant change in 
	Florida and other states' laws concerning the process of identifying mentally 
	ill prisoners, is what makes this collection so valuable.</p>
      <p>Additional material for the Alvin Ford Collection was received from Michael 
	  Radelet in January 2006. This material is not yet inventoried in this finding

          <p>This series contains legal records that are mostly official court 
		  proceedings of the Alvin Ford cases covering a period of seventeen 
		  years. These cases include State of Florida v. Ford: 1974, which covers 
		  the original trial court proceedings. Later cases that bear the same style 
		  relate to later attempts of Ford on a motion for post conviction relief 
		  and stay of execution in 1981 and a second attempt in 1987. Ford v. State 
		  of Florida:1975-1988, Ford v. Strickland et al.: 1981-1984, Ford v. Wainwright: 
		  1981-1988, and Ford v. Dugger: 1986-1991 all represent the trial cases Ford's 
		  attorneys filed against a succession of superintendents of the Florida 
		  State Prison and secretaries of the Department of Corrections. Other 
		  proceedings include multiple trials, pleas, motions, hearings, testimonies, 
		  and appeals. Other legal records are background studies on Ford that include 
		  detailed psychiatric evaluations, medical and prison records, case summaries, 
		  and undated notes by Laurin Wollan.</p>

          <p>This series contains the research material that Ford's 
					defense team accumulated over the course of their representation 
					of Ford and includes research material from years prior to and 
					after the case. This series contains notes on cases in progress 
					as well as some material from related cases. There are newsletters, 
					briefings, pamphlets, bulletins, essays, reports, and publications 
					which discuss anti-death penalty and related legal issues. Also 
					included are photocopies of selections from various undated publications 
					about the death penalty. This series represents literature from a 
					wide spectrum of death penalty abolitionists. Several folders contain 
					news clippings organized by year that give a good overview of related 
					death penalty cases and issues. Many of the news clippings were 
					photocopied before deposit in the Department of Special Collections 
					and Archives, while others required preservation photocopying. Also 
					of note are several papers on death penalty issues written by professors 
					and others representing law schools and universities in the United States.

          <p>This series contains correspondence organized alphabetically by type 
					(sent/received) and by year within each folder. A folder containing 
					character references is noteworthy. These character references were 
					written between late June and early August of 1981, around the time of 
					Ford's parole hearings and clemency case. They are written by his mother, 
					brother, teachers, and friends of the family who knew Ford all of his 
					life. They testify that Ford was a normal, above-average individual who 
					none believed was bent toward murder. Of particular significance is a 
					letter from one of Ford's teachers, Richard Curtis, who said Ford was a 
					model teenager even winning an award for a science project. Correspondence 
					received by Ford are mostly carbon copies retained by Wollan of letters he 
					had sent to Ford. Letters sent by Ford are not represented in this series 
					since they are located within a set of legal papers used in a trial to 
					prove Ford's sanity. They are located in Series One in the folder, Proceedings 
					to Determine Sanity. The General Correspondence folder contains letters 
					that list Laurin Wollan as the recipient of carbon copies, but are not 
					addressed to or from Wollan. Correspondence received by Wollan are usually 
					letters from fellow lawyers and the folders of correspondence sent are 
					carbon copies retained by Wollan that he sent to various individuals.</p>

          <p>This series contains newspaper and magazine articles, most of which 
					are photocopied, about the Ford case. This series also contains a 
					folder related to Ford's death and funeral. Also represented are a 
					small collection of photographs of Ford at various ages and photographs 
					of his attorneys. There is a short note from Connie Ford, Alvin's mother, 
					to Attorney Wollan concerning a video of the Ford funeral, which is also 
					contained in this collection. The most important resource in this series 
					is the news clippings, which are very helpful in following the progression 
					of the Ford case. The news clippings cover most major events in the Ford 
					case. In addition to collecting news clippings, Laurin Wollan had an 
					assistant visit Gainesville, Florida, where Ford was apprehended, and the 
					assistant photocopied all articles from area papers that reported on the 
					Ford story from 1974 to 1975.</p>
